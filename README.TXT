USER INSTRUCTIONS:

The code in this repositiory is from the CodeQuest 2019 competition.
My partner and I had 2.5 hours to work through the problem packet. We started
some problems, but ran out of time or decided it was taking up too much time
and moved on to another one. The only ones that weren't finished during the
competiton are 9, 11, and 14. The rest of the problems posted recieved full
credit from the judges at CodeQuest 2019.
